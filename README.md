# MagicChess-Scripts
Scripts from my MagicChess Unity project, sourced directly from the file directory on my computer.

This is a project I am actively working on; I'd say it's roughly 80% complete. For information on what's left, see **Issues**â€”it's mostly bug-squashing.

## What is it?

MagicChess is an implementation of *Harry Potter's* Wizard's Chess, made in Unity.
